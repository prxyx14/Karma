            <p>
                <font size="+2">&#9757;From its Sanskrit origin, Karma primarily means “action.” Karma is an eastern philosophy that emphasizes that individual actions determine the future consequences of the individual- “what you give in life, you will get in return.
                    ”
                    <br><br><br>&#9757; We named ourselves Karma because we want to bring positive energy into the lives of all Karma wheelchair users. We understand that losing mobility is a scary life challenge, but as long as we strive and spread positive
                    energy, we will overcome our challenges. We believe hard work and a positive attitude will bring good things.
                    <br><br><br> &#9757;For us, because of “Karma,” we take action to help people with disabilities. We do our best to provide quality products to fit everyone’s need and to help them lead a fulfilling life, regardless of the disability.
                    The word, “Karma,” reminds us not to be idle, but instead take action and make a positive contribution to people’s lives.</font>
